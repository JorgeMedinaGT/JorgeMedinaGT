- 👋 Hi, I’m Jorge Medina (@JorgeMedinaGT)
- 👀 I’m interested in statistics, economics, finance, business
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analytics tools like Power BI, SQL, Python, 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data analytics projects
- 📫 How to reach me: jmedinac.gt@gmail.com

Before I knew about data analytics, I loved looking at economic data from newspapers and financial news until it became an obsession. That desire is what brought me here... One day I read about the new digital economy and the potential of data-driven decisions, and it was a turning point.
